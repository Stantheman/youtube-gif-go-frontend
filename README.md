youtube-gif-go-frontend
=======================

This is an example consumer of the [Youtube-Gif-Go](https://github.com/Stantheman/youtube-gif-go/) API project. It uses:

 * [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
 * [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
 * [DoubleSlider](http://mootools.net/forge/p/doubleslider)
 * [Jcrop](http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop.html)
 * [Youtube JS API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference)

Features
--------

Not many since I don't do much frontend stuff. But!

 * You can choose the range of time for the GIF length
 * You can crop the video to the area you want
 * You can optionally send it off to [Gfycat](http://gfycat.com/)
 * The video will loop between the time range you choose so you can see what the GIF should look like
